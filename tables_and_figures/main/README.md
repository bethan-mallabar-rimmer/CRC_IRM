This folder contains code used to generate **Figures 2 and 3** (**Figure 1** was made in PowerPoint not R) and **Table 4** in the main body of the paper. It does not contain code used to generate Tables 1-3 because these were adapted from Supplementary Tables:

**Table 1**</p>
Data in Table 1 is from <a href='https://github.com/bethan-mallabar-rimmer/CRC_IRM/blob/main/tables_and_figures/supplementary/sup_table_2'>Supplementary Table 2</a> columns 1-3.</p>

**Table 2**</p>
Table 2 includes variables with significant p-values only, from columns 1-3 of <a href='https://github.com/bethan-mallabar-rimmer/CRC_IRM/blob/main/tables_and_figures/supplementary/sup_table_6'>Supplementary Table 6</a>

**Table 3**</p>
Table 3 contains columns 1, 3 and 5 (AIC scores only, not ROCAUC models) from <a href='https://github.com/bethan-mallabar-rimmer/CRC_IRM/blob/main/tables_and_figures/supplementary/sup_table_7'>Supplementary Table 7</a>
